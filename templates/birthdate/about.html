					<h1>Founded For A Simple Reason. Continuing For Your Simple Reason.</h1>
					<p>Hey, I am Chance Herriage. A serial-builder that builds the quick and necessary solutions to our every day problems. I am always keeping track of small issues that need some fixing so get in contact if you have a crazy idea, but don‚Äôt know how to develop it.</p>

					<p>üç∞ birthdate came to me after years of struggling to remember my best of friends birthdays. I love them, I really do, it's just a lot of information to keep track of and even when I set a reminder I still somehow forgot.</p>				

					<p>Then my birthday came around this year and I got more late birthday wishes than on the actual day. I wasn't mad, just kind of interested by the people that took the time to say something.</p>

					<p>And thus, I found my newest service to offer to you. No longer will we have to say we forgot or fumble for an excuse when we see them. Just sign up for the service, import your contacts and forget it. There's no maintenance required, there's no unadvertised charges, and most importantly, your friends never have to know you're using automated birthday messages.</p>

					<h2>Well, Won't My Friends Know It's Automated?</h2>
					<p>They <strong>never</strong> have to know that their birthday wishes are automated if you don't want them to, it's completely up to you. </p>

					<p>The way I have set this service up you can choose an option to utilize the most popular community templates so you never wish use the same birthday wish twice. No one will ever be thinking you're just copying and pasting or using an automated service.</p>

					<p>If you do decide to tell them though, you can earn an entire year of usage for 50% off when they sign up from your referral link. 50% off, you question? Yep, exactly. I want everyone to feel appreciated on their birthdays, and with that kind of pricing you have no reason not to be the first person giving amazing and hilarious birthday wishes every time a birthday rolls around.</p>

					<p>If you want something to change; Let's be the first ones to take a step in the direction of that change.</p>
