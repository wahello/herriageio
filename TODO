Lunch o' Munch:
    ☐ Build out the development process.

    ☐ Figure out how to set up DMX records for mailchimp to prevent spam filtering.
    ☐ Add social auth to lunchmunch/launchpad.


    ☐ This isn't going to work anymore in lunchmunch/base.html
        `{% if request.user.profile.has_group %}`
        `    <a href="{% url 'groups' host 'lunch0munch' %}">Groups</a>`
        `{% endif %}``

        or...

        `{% if request.user.profile.zipcode %}`
            `<a href="#">`
            `   📍`
            `{{ request.user.profile.zipcode }}</a>`
        `{% end if %}`


Notes:
    These will only be visible in the debug dashboard. We are basically going to create our own roadmap app, but extremely minimal.

    ☐ We should update the edit_note socket to be fired on every key press and not just the escape of the input.

    ✔ Live resolving. @done(19-02-19 19:34)
        ✔ When we resolve one, they are all resolved. @done(19-02-19 19:34)
        
    ✔ edit_note doesn't woork on notes that were created from add_note @done(19-02-20 11:34)
        ✔ We just need to open a new socket for it :) @done(19-02-20 11:34)

    ☐ Need to add a add_note receiver on all reply forms.

    ☐ We can use Notes as comments as posts. It would be a very nice reusable setup there.
        ☐ https://gyazo.com/5dd9e1bdb933bc1f526d8387a5e4fb8a
            ☐ Process the note replies 

    ☐ Resolve child notes when a parent note is resolved.
    ☐ Make it to where comments can go on comments
    ☐ Added notes don't have the reply form.
    ☐ You can't resolve a recently added note.
    ☐ You can't add more than one note in a sesion currently.
    ☐ The add_note form is actually submiting.
    ☐ We can add parent notes again, but they aren't being displayed.


✔ Implement lunchmunch launch_pad @done(19-02-21 14:28)



☐ Implement dynamic seo tags for titles and descriptions and favicon emoji
    ☐ Each app should have it's own `seo.py`

✔ Remove messages DOM from base and only keep it in page_template.html @done(19-02-18 16:12)

☐ Figure out groups and permissions for users.

☐ LLC Registration
☐ User analytics
    ☐ Be nice to get user loocation. We could automate this process in a couple of child apps when they allow us location access.

☐ Referral credit structure
    ☐ What they get for referring
    ☐ Give them credit for interacting with the community.

☐ [V1.1] Define a community interaction benefiting system.
    ☐ If you help with the voting
        ☐ Could be a section of the leaderbooard part for the users too help us brainstorm the idea! That would be really badass.
            ☐ Allow them to append text and an image for the situations that users go above any beyoond.

☐ Have more than a blog, have an actual place where they can chat and have a sense of community.
    ☐ Public forum.
        ☐ People can make a post about something they want.
            ☐ We respond with our ideas
                ☐ Other people come in and leave their ideas as well!

            ☐ Then we update the post as we build ouot the solution or whatever the process was in relation to that solution.


Parent App Backends:
    ✔ Needs to have cross-subdomain authentication @done(19-02-17 19:25)
    ✔ Needs social auth logins. @done(19-02-17 19:25)

    Events:
        We need to have a system that will allow us to track events very specifically across all children apps. We really would benefit from being able to grab from the history that is displayed in the admin. I really don't understand why that isn't a thing. Or we could just use DjangoSimpleHistory or something similar.

    How I Work:
        ☐ Explain the process of how Mo' Problems functions. Explain the business model to the community.

    Solutions:
        ☐ Stylized page. I am not sure we will be able to do this dyanmically, or that we would even want to.

        ☐ This should probably be a model as well so that we can do some crazy things like publishing time etc... We would need a decorator for views for that, but that is just one thing. There are definitely more functionality things that would come out of this.

        ☐ Comments should also be available for this so that we can judge the communities feedback. The comments would be left on moproblems.io/solution/<solution_name> and not on the actual subdomain as we are going to use that information to cultivate a parent app community.s

    Problems:
        ☐ We need a Problem model that people can tell us about their problems very easily.
            ☐ Needs to be able to upvote and downvote by logged in users.
            
            ☐ Live problem leaderboard with sockets so that we can show some live action and keep people on the website while they are hanging out and watching their problem rise through the ranks.

            ☐ Problem analytics
                ☐ Views
                ☐ Upvotes
                ☐ Downvotes
                ☐ Uptime
                ☐ Comments
                ☐ Comments / Minute

            ☐ Live graph showing the number of votes / downvotes per day

    Outcomes:
        ☐ This will basically serve as a blog for the case studies of each solution

    About Us:
        ☐ Give insight into the team
        ☐ What kind of problems we are solving and why
        ☐ What our passion is behind everything (helping the communities)

    Get In Touch:
        ☐ Contact form with Captcha to prevent spamming.
                    
☐ Build out at least the first 100vh of three children apps and the parent app.
