✔ Have authentication carried over from subdomains. @done(19-02-15 00:05)
    Conclusion:
        This is done with `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN = '.moproblems.io'` and allows us to use the cookies from the base url. For development we have to update our hosts files to contain...
            `127.0.0.1       www.moproblems.io`
            `127.0.0.1       tripweather.moproblems.io`
            `127.0.0.1       lunchmunch.moproblems.io`
            `127.0.0.1       birthdate.moproblems.io`

        Because that is how the production version will read it and that is the only way that the cookies work properly. This was much easier than expected, but also a very different approach than I expected to take to fix this. Now we can direct all user traffic to moproblems, we will just skin a dashboard or something similar. 

        This will need to be discussed in a meeting for UX purposes.

☐ Have automatic admin accounts created for Chance & Mason.
☐ Make the admin_navbar maintain the same style regardless of the childs css

Website Architecture:
    Parent App:
        ☐ model.Profile
            Contains all the personal information of the user that isn't required for logging in. A profile is tied to each User that has a unique email. Each app will have to have certain fields added to the parent Profile object and not in a seperate Profile model for each App.
        
        Base Apps:
            Treather:
                ☐ Inherit model.Profile

            Birthdate:
                ☐ Inherit model.Profile

            Lunch o' Munch :
                ☐ Inherit model.Profile

Base 3 Apps:
    ☐ 🌦️ Treather
    ☐ 🎉 Birthdate
    ☐ 🍔 Lunch o' Munch


Consolidate herriage.io profiles:
    ✔ Add cross-navigation to the the admin-navbar. @done(19-02-06 16:45)
        ☐ We need to make sure that there is a way that we can allow users to stay in while moving across subdomains.
    ☐ Make `www` a central home / portfolio and host the other apps simulatenously.

    ☐ Make all profiles connected across Herriage.io and not in an independent app.
        ☐ We will likely need to create a 'profiles' app that will house all the information for all the users.
            ☐ We already have `profile_handling` app

    Note:
        I am almost positive that every single app currently has their own set of profiles. We need a way to easily sort the data from the app. Perhaps something with the way with of using `app_label` -- Not sure this is really weird.

☐ Create a consistent styling and method for hot-swapping between apps that doesn't intrude on the UI/UX of any of the parent or child app usage.

Herriage.io Styling:
    ☐ Build herriage.io theme
        ☐ Primary color
        ☐ Secondary color
        ☐ Font family
        ☐ Default font size
    ☐ Quick navigation bar
    ☐ Padding

Page Template Structure:
    ☐ herriageio/page_template.html
        ☐ herriageio/admin_navbar.html
        ☐ app/base.html
            ☐ app/page.html
