Consolidate herriage.io profiles:
    ☐ Make all profiles connected across Herriage.io and not in an independent app.
        ☐ We will likely need to create a 'profiles' app that will house all the information for all the users.
            ☐ We already have `profile_handling` app

    Note:
        I am almost positive that every single app currently has their own set of profiles. We need a way to easily sort the data from the app. Perhaps something with the way with of using `app_label` -- Not sure this is really weird.


☐ Change the icon for Birthdate to party horn
