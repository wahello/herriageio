✔ Have authentication carried over from subdomains. @done(19-02-15 00:05)
    Conclusion:
        This is done with `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN = '.moproblems.io'` and allows us to use the cookies from the base url. For development we have to update our hosts files to contain...
            `127.0.0.1       www.moproblems.io`
            `127.0.0.1       tripweather.moproblems.io`
            `127.0.0.1       lunchmunch.moproblems.io`
            `127.0.0.1       birthdate.moproblems.io`

        Because that is how the production version will read it and that is the only way that the cookies work properly. This was much easier than expected, but also a very different approach than I expected to take to fix this. Now we can direct all user traffic to moproblems, we will just skin a dashboard or something similar. 

        This will need to be discussed in a meeting for UX purposes.

    ✔ We cleaned up all the existing links to authentication actions and now we can easily manage the user. @done(19-02-15 14:18)
        Conclusion:
            Now the only thing that is left is adding the actions where they are needed.

        ✔ Social authentication was implemented. It has to be served over HTTPS, but the function 'should' work on the production domain of 'moproblems.io' @done(19-02-15 14:18)

Back Bone:
    ✔ Be able to link across to other subdomains with dynamic urls. @done(19-02-15 08:51)
        ✔ With this change we have to specify the host I believe so a lot of the urls on the already built out pages are breaking. This is going to requiring a change, but it is a neccessary one, so it will be worth it in the end. We couldn't function with hard-coded urls on all pages for all apps. That would be an absolute mess. @done(19-02-15 10:42)

        Notes:
            Yeah, because we are overwriting url. We need the host for almost every url. This may cause problems other dynamic urls, but that is yet to be confirmed.

            This hypothesis was correct. This will easily let us redirect to login, register, logout for the parent app much easier though.

        Research:
            ✘ We may have to update the get_absolute_url with the host as well. I'm not sure yet, but if things start getting screwy, that is likely why. @cancelled(19-02-15 13:47)

        Conclusion:
            ✔ Birthdates urls have been cleaned up. @done(19-02-15 08:59)

    ✔ We should have everything cleaned up before we start adding anything. @done(19-02-15 14:18)
        ✔ This includes removing all authentication related urls from the child apps. If we need them, we will have to update them to the parent apps authentication process anyways and redirecting to the parent apps authentication. @done(19-02-15 14:18)
            Conclusion:
                The links have been left there because authentication is vital to our success and the solution success. But, the actual links have been updated to direct to 'www' authentication.

        ✔ Think of a safe way to store secret files. @done(19-02-15 14:18)
            Notes:
                We could have a 'Key' model that we can M2M of the Solution model and manually create them when we create a solution and as we go.

    ✔ We should restructure the settings project to work of the environment that we need to be in. @done(19-02-15 14:42)

    ✔ If the links are clicked in admin_navbar we should automatically open the navbar when we are redirected to the next url. @done(19-02-15 14:29)

    ✔ We need to add a site_config and the whole jumbo mumbo. @done(19-02-15 14:42)

    ✔ Have automatic admin accounts created for Chance & Mason. @done(19-02-15 15:33)
        ✔ This will be done in apps.py @done(19-02-15 15:33)

        Conclusion:
            This took a lot longer than it should have because I failed to read the documentation of AppConfigs. You have to set the default app_config when you don't want to use the default one.


    ✔ Make the admin_navbar maintain the same style regardless of the childs css @done(19-02-15 16:08)
        ✘ w/ child-app statistics easily extended on the creation of a new app @cancelled(19-02-17 19:22)
            Conclusion:
                This is beyond the scope of the MVP.

        ✔ This is currently a little wacky with the font changing weights or something on the child-app buttons. @done(19-02-15 16:08)

    ✔ Social authentication should work once we are in a live version of the website on moproblems.io @done(19-02-17 19:26)
        ✔ Facebook has it's variables set to `https://www.moproblems.io/` @done(19-02-17 19:26)

        ✔ Move the social keys to site_config.json @done(19-02-17 19:26)

    ✔ Connect automatic integration with marketing email system & that we can have profiles join users for the solutions. @done(19-02-18 15:27)
        ✔ @critical For this to be functionla we really need to make email_address a required field of users. @done(19-02-17 23:53)
            ✔ The error of not having an email has been prevented, but we still need to require the email adress for User creation. @done(19-02-17 22:55)

            Conclusion:
                The field is now included on the SignupForm and it is automatically synced to the User cause it's an awesome form.

        Notes:
            This is vital at this point. With a project focused around community it is absolutely key that we only focus on the community benefiting features before we have a community. (At least until we have a community.) 
        Conclusion:
            This was being so difficult because we had been using the wrong list ID the entire time. It's not the id that is displayed in the browser view and is actually the id that is retrieved when using the API. So, when you want to add a list, you have to retrieve the API list ID before anything will start working.

        ✔ Create a mailchimp list for every child app and then add it to the list of MAILCHIMP_LISTS in `base.py` @done(19-02-16 18:01)
        ✔ Create parent app profile and combine all profiles into the single parent app one. At some point the profile would be an absolutely massive Model @done(19-02-17 19:27)
            Conclusion: 
                With proper setup the model should never actually get too large.

        @critical We need to think through the UX flow more before we go any further:
            Notes:
                With the below structure we would have to change the authentication urls to join if they aren't authenticated. If they are, display the user information.    

                ✔ Every profile should have it's own absolute_url for each child app. @done(19-02-17 19:17)
                    ✔ Update the url from the home page of the child app the profile url of the child app. @done(19-02-17 20:02)
                        ✔ We should just redirect to the dashboard of each the app instead of the absolute url of the profile @done(19-02-17 20:03)
                            Conclusion:
                                Right now this is redirecting to the home of the app. This can be updated later.

                        In the end we just added it, but we had to remove the login_required receiver and instead used the .is_authenticated and then appeneded the ref_app.

                    ☐ Add {{ ref_app }} to both login and sign up urls.

☐ Notes & commands in admin debug panel would be super helpful.

☐ It would be smart to create a skeleton app that we can simply duplicate and get rolling quickly. With base nav templates and all.

☐ This isn't going to work anymore in lunchmunch/base.html
    `{% if request.user.profile.has_group %}`
    `    <a href="{% url 'groups' host 'lunch0munch' %}">Groups</a>`
    `{% endif %}``

    or...

    `{% if request.user.profile.zipcode %}`
        `<a href="#">`
        `   📍`
        `{{ request.user.profile.zipcode }}</a>`
    `{% endif %}`

☐ Implement dynamic seo tags for titles and descriptions and favicon emoji
    ☐ Each app should have it's own `seo.py`

✔ Remove messages DOM from base and only keep it in page_template.html @done(19-02-18 16:12)

☐ Figure out groups and permissions for users.


Parent App Backends:
    ✔ Needs to have cross-subdomain authentication @done(19-02-17 19:25)
    ✔ Needs social auth logins. @done(19-02-17 19:25)

    Events:
        We need to have a system that will allow us to track events very specifically across all children apps. We really would benefit from being able to grab from the history that is displayed in the admin. I really don't understand why that isn't a thing. Or we could just use DjangoSimpleHistory or something similar.

    How I Work:
        ☐ Explain the process of how Mo' Problems functions. Explain the business model to the community.

    Solutions:
        ☐ Stylized page. I am not sure we will be able to do this dyanmically, or that we would even want to.

        ☐ This should probably be a model as well so that we can do some crazy things like publishing time etc... We would need a decorator for views for that, but that is just one thing. There are definitely more functionality things that would come out of this.

        ☐ Comments should also be available for this so that we can judge the communities feedback. The comments would be left on moproblems.io/solution/<solution_name> and not on the actual subdomain as we are going to use that information to cultivate a parent app community.s

    Problems:
        ☐ We need a Problem model that people can tell us about their problems very easily.
            ☐ Needs to be able to upvote and downvote by logged in users.
            
            ☐ Live problem leaderboard with sockets so that we can show some live action and keep people on the website while they are hanging out and watching their problem rise through the ranks.

            ☐ Problem analytics
                ☐ Views
                ☐ Upvotes
                ☐ Downvotes
                ☐ Uptime
                ☐ Comments
                ☐ Comments / Minute

            ☐ Live graph showing the number of votes / downvotes per day

    Outcomes:
        ☐ This will basically serve as a blog for the case studies of each solution

    About Us:
        ☐ Give insight into the team
        ☐ What kind of problems we are solving and why
        ☐ What our passion is behind everything (helping the communities)

    Get In Touch:
        ☐ Contact form with Captcha to prevent spamming.
                    
☐ Build out at least the first 100vh of three children apps and the parent app.
